# Winery test repository

This repository contains TOSCA artifacts managed by Winery used for automated tests.

The files in this branch are taken from the [edmm modelling repository](https://github.com/UST-EDMM/modeling-repository) and are used to test the `org.eclipse.winery.repository.rest.edmm.EdmmResource`.
