Performance test for target allocation minimal external conenctions criteria.

There are 20 node templates present connected with various connectsTos. The topology has no purpose other than to evaluate the performance of the min external connections monte carlo algorithm.
There are two different target locations present in the topology: PastureProvider and FieldProvider.
Each target locations occurs multiple times.
Most of the node templates of the topology have no target location.
After allocating with the minexternalconnections criteria, 4 possible topologies are created where all node templates have one of the existing target location.
