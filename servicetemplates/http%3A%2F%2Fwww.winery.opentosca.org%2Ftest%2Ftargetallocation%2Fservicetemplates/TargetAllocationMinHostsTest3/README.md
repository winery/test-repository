Test for the target allocation minhosts criteria.

Two top level node templates have the target locations PastureProvider and FieldProvider.
One node template has no target location.
Because all top level node templates are hosted together, two possible topologies are created after allocating using the minhosts criteria where top level node template without target location has the target location PastureProvider or FieldProvider.
