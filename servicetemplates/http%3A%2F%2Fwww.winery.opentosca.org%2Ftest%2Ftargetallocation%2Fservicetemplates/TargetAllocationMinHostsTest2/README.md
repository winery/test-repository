Test for the target allocation minhosts criteria.

There is one top level node template with the target location PastureProvider in the topology and two top level node templates without target locations.
Because the 3 top level node templates are hosted together, all node templates receive the same target location (PastureProvider) when allocating using the minhosts criteria, resulting in one topology being created.
