Test for the target allocation minhosts criteria.

There are two top level node templates with the target locations PastureProvider and FieldProvider in the topology.
The five top level node templates on the left have no target location.
Because they are all hosted together, there are 2 possible topologies that are created when allocating using the minhosts criteria. In these topologies the 5 top level node templates either all have the PastureProvider or the FieldProvider.
